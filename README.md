# DenseNet Classification on Tiny Images
In this project we implement two distinct DenseNet architectures to classify images from the Tiny ImageNet dataset in order to replicate the results presented by H. Abai, N. Rajmalwar in “DenseNet Models for Tiny ImageNet Classification”. Link to paper: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1904/1904.10429.pdf


# Network 1
Training of the first network is presented in the Jupyter Notebook file "Final_Project_Part1.ipynb" and is recommended to be run in either Google Colab or Google Cloud Platform. To run using Colab, run the cells marked "IF USING GOOGLE DRIVE:" in order to mount the notebook to the appropriate Google Drive file system. Otherwise, proceed to run the remaining cells in the jupyter notebook.
